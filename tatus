    all now done in Pandas and no data manipulation happening in csv anymore, gap filling of NaN values which represent countries and subtypes that were not assessed but estimated, merge all together and create csv file SSF_subsidies_estimated_assessed, the 'factor' calculation is still wrong, need to re-do the whole procedure once it is clear how to best estimate the missing values using catch data from SAU

    clean code and renew all SSF in pandas to bring fuel estimates into data, need to still figure out how some SSF percentages estimates are now above 100 percent, probably due to the factor calulcation, this needs to be sorted out before continuing with visualization

    looking for errors, going through each data file that has been created, finding different gaps in data, due to either misspellings or as for example means are calculated for subregion whereas there are no assessed SSF subsidy data available form the countries in those subregions for all subtypes, therefore calculating mean per region to fill those gaps
